# Quantium

Description - 
I worked as part of Quantium’s retail analytics team and was approached by the client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region.

The insights from the analysis fed into the supermarket’s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

Main tasks along with what we looked for in the data for each include: 

Examine transaction data – searched for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables. Made necessary modifications to eliminate anomalies.

Examined customer data – checked for similar issues in the customer data, looked for nulls and merged the transaction and customer data together.

Data analysis and customer segments – Defined the metrics – looked at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc. Explored the data, created charts and graphs as well as noting any interesting trends and/or insights found.

Deep dive into customer segments – Defined recommendations from the insights, determined which segments to target, if packet sizes are relative and form an overall conclusion based on the analysis. 

Task 2 - 
For this part of the project I examined the performance in trial vs control stores to provide a recommendation for each location based on uncovered insight. Below are some of the areas I focused on, also discovered other interesting insights in my findings.

Select control stores – Explored the data and defined metrics for control store selection – thought about what would make them a control store. Looked at the drivers and made sure I visualised them in a graph to better determine if they are suited. For this piece I created a function to reduce having to re-do the analysis for each trial store. Considered using Pearson correlations or a metric such as a magnitude distance 1- (Observed distance – minimum distance)/(Maximum distance – minimum distance) as a measure.

Assessment of the trial – This gave some interesting insights into each of the stores, checked each trial store individually in comparison with the control store to get a clear view of its overall performance. I wanted to know if the trial stores were successful or not. 

Collated findings – Summarised the findings for each store and provided a recommendation that I shared with Julia outlining the impact on sales during the trial period.


Observations/Results
Used the Pyramid Principles framework for structuring the report.
Submitted a report that incorporates data visualizations, key callouts., and recommendations.

SETUP/INSTALATION: R Studio, MS Excel, Powerpoint.
